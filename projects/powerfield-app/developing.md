## Add a documentation page for a directive
To add a documentation page for a new directive you have to:
* Add the route and the api documentation in the `data.json` file
* Add the corresponding example component (app/pages/\<directive-type\>/\<directive-name\>)
* Map the new component in the `documentation-example.component.ts`
